Hi! This article is about finding the probabilities for getting each kind of poker hand. 
We will assume a poker hand is five different cards taken from a complete shuffled 52-card deck. 

\section{Two of a kind}

In poker if you have two and only two cards that are the same number in your hand, that is a two of a kind.
For example if you have an 10 of diamonds, a 10 of hearts, a jack of clubs, a king of hearts, and an ace of spades then you have two of a kind.
To figure out the probability you first need to know how many ways are there to get two of a kind.
We'll arrange the cards so that you have the double first.
	
For the first card you can have anything so there are $52$ possibilities.

For the second card it has to be the same so there is one for every other suit you didn't use. $4 - 1 = 3$ possibilities.

For the third card it can be anything as long as its not the same number so you woundn't get three of a kind. $52 - 4 = 48$ possibilities

The fourth card can be any number that didn't appear yet so $44$ possibilities.

For the last card, you can have any number that didn't appear so $40$ possibilities.
You have two ways to rearrange the double and six ways to rearrange it.
So in total you have 

\begin{equation} 
{52 \cdot 3 \cdot 48 \cdot 44 \cdot 40 \over 2 \cdot 6} = 1098240  \hbox{ ways}
\end{equation}

Then you need to figure out how many total hands there are. 

The only rule is that you can't have two of one number so $52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48$.

You  still need to divide by $5!$ cause order doesn't matter.

You have 
\begin{equation}
{52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48 \over 5!} = 2596980 \hbox{ total hands}
\end{equation}

Now you take the amount of ways and divide by the total amount of hands.

\begin{equation}
{1098240 \over 2596980} = {352 \over 833} = 42.26% probability}
\end{equation}
